Devoxx Genie is a fully Java-based LLM Code Assistant plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, designed to integrate with local LLM providers such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html), [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and [Exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo) but also cloud based LLM's such as [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), [Groq](https://groq.com/), [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), [DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com/dash/deployments), [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/), [OpenRouter](https://www.openrouter.ai/) and [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service)

We now also support RAG-based prompt context based on your vectorized project files. 
In addition to Git Dif viewer and LLM-driven web search with [Google](https://developers.google.com/custom-search) and [Tavily](https://tavily.com/).

With Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DevoxxGenie isn't just another developer tool... it's a glimpse into the future of software engineering. As we eagerly await Claude 3.5 Opus, one thing is clear: we're witnessing a paradigm shift in Ai Augmented Programming (AAP) üêí

### üî• NEW RAG Feature 

<img width="749" alt="RAG" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea34247a-b33d-40a2-b96a-d10de0868dfa">

Devoxx Genie now includes starting from v0.4.0 a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) feature, which enables advanced code search and retrieval capabilities. 
This feature uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze code snippets and identify relevant results based on their semantic meaning.

With RAG, you can:

* Search for code snippets using natural language queries
* Retrieve relevant code examples that match your query's intent
* Explore related concepts and ideas in the codebase

We currently use Ollama and Nomic Text embedding to generates vector representations of your project files.
These embedding vectors are then stored in a Chroma DB running locally within Docker. 
The vectors are used to compute similarity scores between search queries and your code all running locally.

The RAG feature is a significant enhancement to Devoxx Genie's code search capabilities, enabling developers to quickly find relevant code examples and accelerate their coding workflow.

### LLM Settings
In the IDEA settings you can modify the REST endpoints and the LLM parameters.  Make sure to press enter and apply to save your changes.

We now also support Cloud based LLMs, you can paste the API keys on the Settings page.

### Smart Model Selection and Cost Estimation
The language model dropdown is not just a list anymore, it's your compass for smart model selection.

![Models](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/1924a967-37c3-400c-bac4-fc1a678aeec5)

See available context window sizes for each cloud model
View associated costs upfront
Make data-driven decisions on which model to use for your project

### Add Project to prompt & clipboard

You can now add the full project to your prompt IF your selected cloud LLM has a big enough window context.

![AddFull](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/be014cf1-ee01-428a-bd75-55acc82627fb)

### Calc Cost

Leverage the prompt cost calculator for precise budget management. Get real-time updates on how much of the context window you're using.

![AddCalcProject](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/0c971331-40fe-47a4-8ede-f349fa40c00c)

See the input/output costs and window context per Cloud LLM.  Eventually we'll also allow you to edit these values.

### Handling Massive Projects?
"But wait," you might say, "my project is HUGE!" üòÖ 

Fear not! We've got options:

1. Leverage Gemini's Massive Context: 

Gemini's colossal 1 million token window isn't just big, it's massive. We're talking about the capacity to digest approximately 30,000 lines of code in a single go. That's enough to digest most codebases whole, from the tiniest scripts to some decent projects.

But if that's not enough you have more options...

2. Smart Filtering: 

The new "Copy Project" panel lets you: 

Exclude specific directories 
Filter by file extensions
Remove JavaDocs to slim down your context

<img width="1072" alt="ScanProject" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51523394-1b36-442b-adfa-91d0c7a8182e">

3. Selective Inclusion 

Right-click to add only the most relevant parts of your project to the context.

![RightClick](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin/assets/179457/a86c311a-4589-41f9-bb4a-c8c4f0b884ee)

## Git Diff viewer
Starting from v0.3.0, you can enable a Git diff/merge viewer to directly review and accept LLM-generated code changes without needing to copy and paste them from the LLM's response.
To activate this feature, navigate to Settings and select "LLM Git Diff Merge." You can then choose between a two-panel or three-panel Git diff view.

![git_diff](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/114bb3cf-2824-442b-bdd3-483fb0d58983)
![diff_merge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eec2d6c8-5145-4729-8962-7033807018b1)

For example, the two-panel Git diff view works seamlessly with the local Ollama LLM provider and the Llama 3.2 3B model.

## The Power of Full Context: A Real-World Example
The DevoxxGenie project itself, at about 70K tokens, fits comfortably within most high-end LLM context windows. 
This allows for incredibly nuanced interactions ‚Äì we're talking advanced queries and feature requests that leave tools like GitHub Copilot scratching their virtual heads!

## Support for JLama & LLama3.java
DevoxxGenie now also supports the 100% Modern Java LLM inference engines: [JLama](https://github.com/tjake/Jlama).

JLama offers a REST API compatible with the widely-used OpenAI API.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65096be3-2b34-4fea-8295-d63e04066390)

You can also integrate it seamlessly with [Llama3.java](https://github.com/stephanj/Llama3JavaChatCompletionService) but using the Spring Boot OpenAI API wrapper coupled with the JLama DevoxxGenie option.

## Local LLM Cluster with Exo

V0.2.7 also supports Exo, a local LLM cluster for Apple Silicon which allows you to run Llama 3.1 8b, 70b and 405b on your own Apple computers ü§©
